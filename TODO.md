- Do something about email templates
- Remove ticketing stuff
- multiple databases in sqlite doesnt work. Many problems
  -- has table doesn't support db.table format, but you can look up tables existing in db.sqlite_master
  -- knex doesn't seem to support multiple dbs well, or sqlite. SQLite does funky stuff like if given a table name in multiple tables, just use the first db loaded.
- Rename DB and Databases to packages, modules, library, namespaces, or something. Its more that databases and tables. Email and Event are not ables at all

- need to auto create dbs and give user access... somehow.
